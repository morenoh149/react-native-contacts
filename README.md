| Key Name   | Value Type | Description |

#### socialServices

** IMPLEMENTATION PENDING **

| uid | String | The user ID for this contact on this service
| name | String | The name of this user on this service


#### Notes on Adding and Updating thumbnailPath

When calling addContact():

Android
>Should be the full size image for the contact in jpeg format. If the image is high-resoltuion, a low-resolution thumbnail will automatically be generated to be used in conjunction with the contact image.

iOS
>TBD

When calling updateContact():

>If you are updating a contact retrieved from getAll(), remove thumbnailPath from your contact object if the photo should not be updated. The API can not determine if the current profile photo and thumbnailPath are the same and will always copy the thumbnailPath image (which is slow)


## Example Contact Record
```js
{
  recordID: 1,

  familyName: "Jung",
  givenName: "Carl",
  middleName: "C.",
  nickName: "Carl-o",
  phoenticGivenName: "CAR-el",
  phoneticFamilyName: "YUH-ng",

  company: "Foomatics, Inc.",
  jobTitle: "Developer",

  phoneNumbers: [
    {
      label: "mobile",
      number: "(555) 555-5555",
      primary: true,
    },{
      label: "work",
      number: "(555) 555-5556",
    }
  ],

  emailAddresses: [{
    label: "work",
    email: "carl-jung@example.com",
  }],

  websites: [{
    label: "homepage",
    url: "http://www.carljung.com/",
  }],

  postalAddresses: [{
    label: "work",
    street: "123 N Main Street",
    city: "Chicago",
    region: "IL", //Illinois in USA
    postcode: "12345-A234",
    country: "US",
  }],

  note: "This is a note",

  birthday: {
      month: 6,
      day: 12,
  },

  thumbnailPath: "file:///device/path/to/image.jpg",
}
```

## Usage
`getAll` is a database intensive process, and can take a long time to complete depending on the size of the contacts list. Because of this, it is recommended you access the `getAll` method before it is needed, and cache the results for future use.

Also there is a lot of room for performance enhancements in both iOS and android. PR's welcome!

```js
var Contacts = require('react-native-contacts')

Contacts.getAll((err, contacts) => {
  if(err && err.type === 'permissionDenied'){
    // x.x
  } else {
    console.log(contacts)
  }
})
```

## Adding Contacts
Currently all fields from the contact record except for thumbnailPath are supported for writing
```js
var newPerson = {
  emailAddresses: [{
    label: "work",
    email: "mrniet@example.com",
  }],
  familyName: "Nietzsche",
  givenName: "Friedrich",
}

Contacts.addContact(newPerson, (err) => { /*...*/ })
```

## Updating and Deleting Contacts
```js
//contrived example
Contacts.getAll( (err, contacts) => {
  //update the first record
  let someRecord = contacts[0]
  someRecord.emailAddresses.push({
    label: "junk",
    email: "mrniet+junkmail@test.com",
  })
  Contacts.updateContact(someRecord, (err) => { /*...*/ })

  //delete the second record
  Contacts.deleteContact(contacts[1], (err) => { /*...*/ })
})
```
Update and delete reference contacts by their recordID (as returned by the OS in getContacts). Apple does not guarantee the recordID will not change, e.g. it may be reassigned during a phone migration. Consequently you should always grab a fresh contact list with `getContacts` before performing update and delete operations.

You can also delete a record using only it's recordID like follows: `Contacts.deleteContact({recordID: 1}, (err) => {})}`

## Displaying Thumbnails

The thumbnailPath is the direct URI for the temp location of the contact's cropped thumbnail image.

```js
<Image source={{uri: contact.thumbnailPath}} />
```

## Getting started
run `npm install react-native-contacts`

### iOS
1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` âžœ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. add `./node_modules/react-native-contacts/ios/RCTContacts.xcodeproj`
3. In the XCode project navigator, select your project, select the `Build Phases` tab and in the `Link Binary With Libraries` section add **libRCTContacts.a**

#### Permissions
As of Xcode 8 and React Native 0.33 it is now **necessary to add kit specific "permission" keys** to your Xcode `Info.plist` file, in order to make `requestPermission` work. Otherwise your app crashes when requesting the specific permission. I discovered this after days of frustration.

Open Xcode > Info.plist > Add a key (starting with "Privacy - ...") with your kit specific permission. The value for the key is optional.

You have to add the key "Privacy - Contacts Usage Description".

### Android
* In `android/settings.gradle`
```gradle
...
include ':react-native-contacts'
project(':react-native-contacts').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../node_modules/react-native-contacts/android')
```

* In `android/app/build.gradle`
```gradle
...
dependencies {
    ...
    compile project(':react-native-contacts')
}
```

* register module (in android/app/src/main/java/com/[your-app-name]/MainApplication.java)
```java
	...

	import com.rt2zz.reactnativecontacts.ReactNativeContacts; 	// <--- import module!

	public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
	    ...

	    @Override
	    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
	      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
	        new MainReactPackage(),
	        new ReactNativeContacts() 	// <--- and add package
	      );
	    }

    	...
    }
```
If you are using an older version of RN (i.e. `MainApplication.java` does not contain this method (or doesn't exist) and MainActivity.java starts with `public class MainActivity extends Activity`) please see the [old instructions](https://github.com/rt2zz/react-native-contacts/tree/1ce4b876a416bc2ca3c53e7d7e0296f7fcb7ce40#android)

* add Contacts permission (in android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
(only add the permissions you need)
```xml
...
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PROFILE" />
...
```

## Permissions Methods (optional)
`checkPermission` (callback) - checks permission to access Contacts.  
`requestPermission` (callback) - request permission to access Contacts.  

Usage as follows:
```js
Contacts.checkPermission( (err, permission) => {
  // Contacts.PERMISSION_AUTHORIZED || Contacts.PERMISSION_UNDEFINED || Contacts.PERMISSION_DENIED
  if(permission === 'undefined'){
    Contacts.requestPermission( (err, permission) => {
      // ...
    })
  }
  if(permission === 'authorized'){
    // yay!
  }
  if(permission === 'denied'){
    // x.x
  }
})
```

These methods do **not** re-request permission if permission has already been granted or denied. This is a limitation in iOS, the best you can do is prompt the user with instructions for how to enable contacts from the phone settings page `Settings > [app name] > contacts`.

On android permission request is done upon install so this function will only show if the  permission has been granted.

## Todo
- [ ] android feature parity
- [ ] migrate iOS from AddressBook to Contacts
- [ ] implement `get` with options
- [ ] groups support
