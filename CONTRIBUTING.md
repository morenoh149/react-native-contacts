# Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone beginner or advanced. Please before working on some feature

* search through the past issues, your concern may have been raised by others in the past. Check through
closed issues as well.
* if there is no open issue for your feature request please open one up to coordinate all collaborators
* write your feature
* submit a feature test on https://github.com/morenoh149/react-native-contacts-test to test it's integration
* submit a pull request on this repo, and describe:
  * a brief description
  * what operating systems are affected
  * **detail of the expected change(s) in behaviour**
  * how to test it (if it's not obvious)
  
Ask someone to test it (offer to test someone else's PR in exchange for testing yours). The contributors don't always have time to test so it's great when the community can help out.

Things to note:

* we much more prefer features that work for all platforms (ios and Android)
* we do accept features for a single platform but that adds maintenance and documentation overhead,
please note on the PR if your feature only works for a single platform
