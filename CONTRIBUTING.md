# Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone beginner or advanced. Please before working on some feature

* search through the past issues, your concern may have been raised by others in the past. Check through
closed issues as well.
* if there is no open issue for your feature request please open one up to coordinate all collaborators
* write your feature
* submit a feature test on https://github.com/morenoh149/react-native-contacts-test to test it's integration
* submit a pull request on this repo

Things to note:

* we much more prefer features that work for all platforms (ios and Android)
* we do accept features for a single platform but that adds maintenance and documentation overhead,
please note on the PR if your feature only works for a single platform
